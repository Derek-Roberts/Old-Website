<h1 style="text-align: center">What is Web Design</h1>
	<p style="text-align: center" dir="ltr">Web design is the application of visual or auditory media through the use of a web page on the world wide web. Web designers are able to shape a blank white page into something that truly catches the eye or conveys a message. Code can look like an ancient language to some but to web designers it's a tool that can make their lives either simple or a living hell. Web design is crucial in society today yet it wasn't even a concept 50 years ago. Who would have thought that a basic network build by brilliant minds within the military would end up soaking up countless hours of our days with cat videos and social networking. Without this network some say we might be a bit more productive, others say that we wouldn't have the great knowledge of the almighty Wikipedia to guide us through our term papers but one thing is fairly certain; without the internet web developers would be out of a job. &nbsp;Without web developers we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to feed our youtube addictions but without web design the page that the videos, cat pictures, and information resides on would be such an eyesore that you may never want to return, thus getting less ad clicks and in turn making the web developer upset since they must now figure out which size cardboard box to live in after their house forecloses.</br></br>
	I once heard CSS described as being that one shutter shade that would never shut right no matter how hard you tried to even out the two little strings that are in your hands. &nbsp;With that in mind I&rsquo;m going to try to turn the background to a different color with CSS. &nbsp;Wish me luck. &nbsp;</p>
